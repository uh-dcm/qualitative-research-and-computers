# ATLAS.ti for audio, video and images

For basic use of ATLAS.ti, such as installation of ATLAS.ti and creatung a new project: see [tutorial on ATLAS.ti as a tool for open coding](../../open-coding/atlasti_9_desktop).

For video and images, use the desktop software for ATLAS.ti

## Importing images and videos

The importing works in principle similarly to [text data](../open-coding/atlasti/#importing-documents) on ATLAS.ti

However, it is possible to choose if video documents are imported or linked to the project.
Linking means that the video files are kept on their original location on the hard drive, while on importing brings them as part of the project file.
For small videos, it is good to import them to the project file (so that everything is in the same location), but for larger files linking will make the system more stable.

## Coding and Analysing the data

The coding procedure is fairly similar [text data](../open-coding/atlasti/##doing-data-analysis) on ATLAS.ti
