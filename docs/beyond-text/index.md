# Beyond text

Social scientists study content which is not textual, such images and video content.
There are extensive approaches to work with such visual materials ([Margolis & Pauwels, 2020](https://methods.sagepub.com/book/the-sage-handbook-of-visual-research-methods-2e), [Banks, 2015](https://methods.sagepub.com/book/visual-methods-in-social-research-2e)), all of which can be supported with computer software tools.
(The exact choice of the research approach and thus methodology is highly dependent on your research question.)

We will briefly examine how computing tools support both [manual annotation](atlasti) as well as [automatic content extraction](imagerecognition) from images and videos.

## Example papers

Sometimes it is easier to understand how the methods are used by examining papers showing how it has been used. The papers have been chosen so that the teaching team has been involved in analysing and writing them and we are happy to discuss any details in these and show how computers were used in write-up of this process.
