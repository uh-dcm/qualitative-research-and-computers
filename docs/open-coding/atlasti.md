# Atlas.TI

Atlas.TI is one of many software available to assist with qualitative analysis.
It specially excels in open coding, i.e., attaching interpretations and concepts to the material during the analysis stage.

### Setting up the project

After starting Atlas.TI, you first need to create a new project.
Project corresponds to a set of materials related to your research project, for example all interview materials for your collection.
Ideally, this corresponds to a cohesive set of materials used within a single paper or single documents.

### Importing documents

After creating the project, you need to import your data into the project.
In Atlas.TI, data is organised into documents corresponding a single piece _unit of data_, such as an individual interview.
Data can be in various formats, such as in Microsoft Word (`.docx`), plain text format (`.txt`), rich text format (`.rtf`) or even in Portable Document Files (`.pdf`).
For interview materials, I recommend using Microsoft Word as these files can be edited e.g. for typos within Atlas.TI.
However, do note that any changes made to the documents in Atlas.TI (fixing typos, anonymisation, coding) is not reflected back to the raw data files.
