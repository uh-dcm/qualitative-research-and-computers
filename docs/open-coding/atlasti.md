# Atlas.TI

Atlas.TI is one of many software available to assist with qualitative analysis.
It specially excels in open coding, i.e., attaching interpretations and concepts to the material during the analysis stage.

### Setting up the project

After starting Atlas.TI, you first need to create a new project.
Project corresponds to a set of materials related to your research project, for example all interview materials for your collection.
Ideally, this corresponds to a cohesive set of materials used within a single paper or single documents.

### Importing documents

After creating the project, you need to import your data into the project.
In Atlas.TI, data is organised into documents corresponding a single piece _unit of data_, such as an individual interview.
Data can be in various formats, such as in Microsoft Word (`.docx`), plain text format (`.txt`), rich text format (`.rtf`) or even in Portable Document Files (`.pdf`).
For interview materials, I recommend using Microsoft Word as these files can be edited e.g. for typos within Atlas.TI.
However, do note that any changes made to the documents in Atlas.TI (fixing typos, anonymisation, coding) is not reflected back to the raw data files.

## Doing data analysis

### Coding materials

Coding takes place through selecting segments of the text to create an quotation.
**Quotations** are segments of texts connected to one or more codes, shown on the right margin of the text.
These codes summarise the conceptual observation, they are later used to further examine the data -- they correspond to your analysis.
There are two ways to code: **open coding** allows you to enter the name of the code manually or choose it from previously used codes, while **in-vivo code** corresponds the selected quotation.
For example, certain key phrases used in the data may be better to reflect using in-vivo coding, but often open coding allows more analytical considerations.
Quotations can be overlap or be inside other codes if that makes sense.

### Code manager

During research project, many codes emerge.
At least for me, some of them are typos which need to be edited.
Some of them may be the same conceptual idea, which has evolved during the work.
Code Manager is the interface to rename, merge, split and even remove codes.
This helps to maintain the potentially messy list of codes.

Furthermore, it is possible to group codes into wider **code groups** to aggregate data into more conceptual tools.
Similarly, it is possible to change the colour of codes to help further manage the complexity of the codes.
