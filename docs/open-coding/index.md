# Open coding

Open coding refers to qualitative research practice where material is coded without a pre-defined code list.
Instead, potential codes are entered to the material while it is analysed.
Thus, it is an inductive approach, where the aim is to let the data speak for itself.

Open coding is most familiar from **grounded theory approach**.
[Grounded theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory) is based on examining the material and conducting

1. open coding to examine and familiarise with the materials
1. axial coding to examine and integrate open codes
1. making memos about thoughts and observations throughout open and axial coding
1. developing a theoretical model based on axial codes and memos

Grounded theory is a well-adapted methodological framework, however it has various different ways to approach and use it within a specific research process ([Birks et al., 2013](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1057/ejis.2012.48), [Ralph et al., 2015](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1609406915611576)).

However, open coding can be used with other kinds of analysis approaches as well if the aim is to work in inductive manner.
For example, scholars can work with a specific lens when examining the data, such as frames (in [frame analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_analysis)).
Developing a new theory - which is the outcome of the grounded theory process - is sometimes outside the scope of the research question.
Sometimes it is sufficient to understand the themes emerging from the data, this is done via [thematic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_analysis). prefer to focus only on **thematic analysis**.
How you choose and articulate your methods depends on your specific field of study and established practices within there.
Qualitative software can support any of these methods to conduct data analysis.

## Open coding: a summary

Grounded theory, thematic analysis, frame analysis and other open coding-based analysis methods each involve their own terminology and conventions how to analyse and present methods.
However, the methods often involve stages such as

1. familiarizing with the material and conducting open coding
1. discussing with colleagues about the codes and clarifying their meanings
1. conducting additional coding after discussion
1. summarising open codes by organising them
1. reporting findings

## What is a good code?

This depends on your research interests.
There are two common pitfalls: either not coding data sufficiently or then conducting too fine-grained analysis, where the coding does not summarise data.
While it is impossible to provide a universal guideline for this, I would be scared if a sentence had several overlapping codes.
I would also be scared if most paragraphs had no codes.

## What about validity?

Open coding is always based on interpretations.
Depending on how approach your research problem, different approaches may be helpful to be incorporated into the analysis process, such as being reflexive about the analysis process, seeking to find evidence to disconfirm observations or involving other researchers in the process (for more, see [Creswell & Miller, 2000](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15430421tip3903_2)).

## Example papers

Sometimes it is easier to understand how the methods are used by examining papers showing how it has been used.
The papers have been chosen so that the teaching team has been involved in analysing and writing them and we are happy to discuss any details in these and show how computers were used in write-up of this process.
