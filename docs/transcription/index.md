# Transcription of data

Data such as interviews is originally recorded as audio but is transformed into text through **transcription**.
Different research approaches may have more specific guidelines how this should be done, and specific notations to use in transcription.
For example

* should one measure pauses, overlaps on of speech turns or specific articulations of words (known as _narrow transcription_)
* is the aim to get an overview of the answer, thus it may be acceptable to transform speech to standard language

## Software for transcription

* [otranscribe.com](https://otranscribe.com/) is an online service making it easy to transcribe materials and has keyboard shortcuts for commands such as pausing/playing audio, skipping backwards or forwards.
These make it easier to work on the material.
* [Microsoft Office](microsoft_office) does decent job automatically transcribing audio material into text in several languages, such as Finnish and English.
* [Otter](https://otter.ai/) is an online service for making meeting notes, but it does also work with interviews.
It only works in English language.
