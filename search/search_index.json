Instead, potential codes are entered to the material while it is analysed. Thus, it is an inductive approach, where the aim is to let the data speak for itself. Open coding is most familiar from grounded theory approach . Grounded theory is based on examining the material and conducting open coding to examine and familiarise with the materials axial coding to examine and integrate open codes making memos about thoughts and observations throughout open and axial coding developing a theoretical model based on axial codes and memos Grounded theory is a well-adapted methodological framework, however it has various different ways to approach and use it within a specific research process ( Birks et al., 2013 , Ralph et al., 2015 ). However, open coding can be used with other kinds of analysis approaches as well if the aim is to work in inductive manner. For example, scholars can work with a specific lens when examining the data, such as frames (in frame analysis ). Developing a new theory - which is the outcome of the grounded theory process - is sometimes outside the scope of the research question. Sometimes it is sufficient to understand the themes emerging from the data, this is done via thematic analysis . prefer to focus only on thematic analysis . How you choose and articulate your methods depends on your specific field of study and established practices within there. Qualitative software can support any of these methods to conduct data analysis. Open coding: a summary Grounded theory, thematic analysis, frame analysis and other open coding-based analysis methods each involve their own terminology and conventions how to analyse and present methods. However, the methods often involve stages such as familiarizing with the material and conducting open coding discussing with colleagues about the codes and clarifying their meanings conducting additional coding after discussion summarising open codes by organising them reporting findings What is a good code? This depends on your research interests. There are two common pitfalls: either not coding data sufficiently or then conducting too fine-grained analysis, where the coding does not summarise data. While it is impossible to provide a universal guideline for this, I would be scared if a sentence had several overlapping codes. I would also be scared if most paragraphs had no codes. What about validity? Open coding is always based on interpretations. Depending on how approach your research problem, different approaches may be helpful to be incorporated into the analysis process, such as being reflexive about the analysis process, seeking to find evidence to disconfirm observations or involving other researchers in the process (for more, see Creswell & Miller, 2000 ).

University of Helsinki Mac Personal computer Install from Download Centre . University of Helsinki Windows University of Helsinki Install from Software Center . University of Helsinki Windows Personal computer Install from Download Centre . Setting up the project After starting Atlas.TI, you first need to create a new project. Project corresponds to a set of materials related to your research project, for example all interview materials for your collection. Ideally, this corresponds to a cohesive set of materials used within a single paper or single documents. Importing documents After creating the project, you need to import your data into the project. In Atlas.TI, data is organised into documents corresponding a single piece unit of data , such as an individual interview. Data can be in various formats, such as in Microsoft Word ( .docx ), plain text format ( .txt ), rich text format ( .rtf ) or even in Portable Document Files ( .pdf ). For interview materials, I recommend using Microsoft Word as these files can be edited e.g. for typos within Atlas.TI. However, do note that any changes made to the documents in Atlas.TI (fixing typos, anonymisation, coding) is not reflected back to the raw data files. Doing data analysis Coding materials Coding takes place through selecting segments of the text to create an quotation. Quotations are segments of texts connected to one or more codes, shown on the right margin of the text. These codes summarise the conceptual observation, they are later used to further examine the data -- they correspond to your analysis. There are two ways to code: open coding allows you to enter the name of the code manually or choose it from previously used codes, while in-vivo code corresponds the selected quotation. For example, certain key phrases used in the data may be better to reflect using in-vivo coding, but often open coding allows more analytical considerations. Quotations can be overlap or be inside other codes if that makes sense. It is possible to create codes automatically: use certain key phrases and automatically code sentences or paragraphs where they are used. Managing and organising codes During research project, many codes emerge. At least for me, some of them are typos which need to be edited. Some of them may be the same conceptual idea, which has evolved during the work. Code Manager is the interface to rename, merge, split and even remove codes. This helps to maintain the potentially messy list of codes. Furthermore, it is possible to group codes into wider code groups to aggregate data into more conceptual tools. Similarly, it is possible to change the colour of codes to help further manage the complexity of the codes. From codes back to quotation After the code stage, the analysis moves forward. During this time, it is often necessarily to see the quotations for each code. To access these, quotation manager is used. The essential use for quotation manager is to have an easy access to your research materials based on the codes and code groups established in the prior step. Quotation manager allows to export (create an report) of all quotations under a single code. As the name report suggests, this can be helpful to report the data. More complex analysis Atlas.TI is an versatile environment ot work with qualitative data. For example, it allows to conduct queries to the data, examining if codes overlap or are near-by each other. Thus, one can examine data using combinations of codes throught search interface. It is also possible to create linkages between codes. These can be visualised as a network to help further analysis of them. The network view can help to examine how documents, quotations and codes together visually.","title":"Atlas.TI"},{"location":"open-coding/atlasti/#atlasti","text":"Atlas.TI is one of many software available to assist with qualitative analysis.
